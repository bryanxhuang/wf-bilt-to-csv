If you're ever unsure if a large purchase will be approved, you can use the Check Spending Power tool in your online account or mobile app. Please note that in a small number of cases, we may assign a specific spending limit to a Card Member's account due to a variety of factors such as the Card Member's credit score, past due payments with us or other creditors, or high balances on revolving credit accounts.
